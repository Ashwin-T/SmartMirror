ï»¿# Smart Mirror by Ashwin T
My project is building and coding a Smart Mirror from scratch. The Smart Mirror is a mirror with a display behind it allowing it to show different components onto the screen. I am using a Rasberry Pi to run and display the code I have written. I wrote the code using React and numerous other JavaScript libraries incuding Moment.js and Electron.js, which allows the program to run as an application on a Linux operating system. I also used other node modules and APIs including the spotify API and OpenWeather API to display real time data. I hope to use my Smart Mirror to managa and organize my busy life.
